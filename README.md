After 30 years of publication, the open access peer reviewed journal _First Monday_ will be ceasing publication. The community of internet researchers is quite saddened by this news, and there has already been a great deal of interest in finding ways to continue the journal's operations. While much remains to be seen about what will happen next, it seems prudent to ensure that this invaluable piece of internet history is adequately preserved.

I am working on a simple project to mirror all publications from _First Monday_ to ensure that this rich collection of scholarship is not lost.
